Windows

Event Viewer is your friend
Autoruns is your friend
Process Explorer and TCP View are your friend
OSSEC works for windows too 
(agent only, must talk to a Linux server for reporting)
Change passwords and fast! (Automate if possible)
Remove unused users and services
Turn your firewall on and REMOVE EXCEPTIONS
Turn off Teredo

Mark Russinovich is your friend.

Changing Passwords Fast
Program one:
AutoIt (make a binary to do it faster)
Download one:
http://bit.ly/bulkpasswordcontrol (AD only - not local)
Advantage: pseudo random passwords
Built in one:
dsquery user ou=Users,dc=testlab,dc=net | dsmod user -pwd RedTeamSucks! -mustchpwd yes
LAPS for local admin passwords (Not built in, but it is Microsoft tool) https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/3062591.aspx


Windows Admin - GPO (Security)

Some specific Windows Group Policy to set
Security Options
Network security: LAN Manager authentication level - Send NTLMv2  response only\refuse NTLM & LM
Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change - Enabled
Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares - Enabled
Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts - Enabled
Network access: Allow anonymous SID/name translation - Disabled
Accounts: Rename administrator account - Rename to something unique (but remember it)
Interactive logon: Message text for users attempting to log on - sometimes an inject


Audit Policy
Learn to configure windows audit logs and understand the events.
Audit process tracking - Successes
Audit account management - Successes, Failures
Audit logon events - Successes, Failures
Audit account logon events - Successes, Failures


User Rights Assignment
Debug programs - Remove all groups/users
Allow log on through Terminal Services - Leave blank to disallow login via TS even if it has been started.


Windows Admin - Local GPO
Local GPO is much faster to push out on small networks, and can be applied to any Windows system, not just domain joined ones (plus if the attacker kicks a box off the domain, domain GPO goes away). There isn't an easy way to do it for all GPO settings, but for security ones 'secedit' is your friend.
-- Export a config from a VM or other default install for reference:
secedit /export /cfg checkme.inf
-- Edit to to have more secure settings then import onto your target system: 
secedit /configure /db secedit.sdb /cfg securecheckme.inf


Web


(get the linux admin to install it quickly, and get comfortable installing it on Windows)
http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2013/04/web-application-defenders-cookbook-ccdc-blue-team-cheatsheet.html (just ignore the honey traps portion, you normally won’t have time to set or monitor for them)
Passwords… find them, reset them, most likely the Red Team found them first
Look for administrative interfaces and restrict them to localhost or an “admin” box


As quick as possible figure out the use of the web apps provided and how they play into the “company” you are pretending to be.
Watch logs, get them shipped somewhere, syslog, splunk, something so you can watch them all at once.

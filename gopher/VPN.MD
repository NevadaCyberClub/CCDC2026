Good Afternoon,

Team 7 has surveyed numerous VPN options and as a collective, we agreed that the three best VPNs to implement in our company were Wireguard, OpenVPN, and FreeLan.

### Virtual Private Network Comparison

In regards to picking a VPN, a company must highlight crucial factors such as speed, security, and reliability. In the case of our company and specifically allowing employees access to the company's internal network, **Wireguard** is the safest, fastest, most reliable, and easiest to set up out of the three. **OpenVPN** has strong and secure internet protocol security but lacks in speed and simplicity. **FreeLan** offers a unique peer-to-peer structure but is not suitable for a companyâ€™s environment such as ours.

### Wireguard Setup, Configuration, and Deployment

1. Download Wireguard Service
2. Generate Private and Public keys
3. Set up interfaces
4. Add clients and their respective keys

> **NOTE**: We are currently conducting testing on it to ensure the best service.

### Wireguard Usage Guide

Wireguard is available on all major platforms, thereby making it accessible for non-technical employees. Here is how a user can access the VPN:

1. First, you have to install the Wireguard client, as referenced in the image below at [https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
2. Next, you will want to add a tunnel
3. Create and scan a QR code from the company
4. Add VPN Configuration to device
5. Connect your device to VPN server
6. Turn on the VPN setting in the iPhone settings.
